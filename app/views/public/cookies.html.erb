      This Cookie Notice explains how Beepi.cc and its group companies (“Beepi”, “we”, “us” and “ours”) use cookies and similar tracking
      technologies, including SDKs (together, “cookies”) on or through our website at
      <a href="https://beepi.cc" class="text-purple-700 underline">https://beepi.cc</a> (“Platform”). It explains what these
      technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">What are cookies?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Cookies are small data files placed on your computer or mobile device. Website owners can use cookies for a variety of reasons, including:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>Enabling the website to work (or work more efficiently).</li>
        <li>Providing personalized content and advertising.</li>
        <li>Gathering analytics on site usage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Cookies set by Beepi are called “first-party cookies.” Only Beepi can access these. Cookies set by other parties are “third-party
        cookies” and power things like social embeds, ads, or analytics across multiple sites.

    <!-- Why do we use cookies? -->
    <div class="text-left mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">Why do we use cookies?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        We use both first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Essential cookies:</strong> Strictly necessary to provide core Beepi services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics cookies:</strong> Help us understand how you use our Platform so we can improve it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Personalization cookies:</strong> Tailor your experience with content and features you’ll find most relevant.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Advertising cookies:</strong> Show you ads that match your interests, whether on Beepi or elsewhere.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Beepi users may also choose to enable additional cookies on their public profiles for their own analytics or marketing purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Other tracking technologies -->
    <div class="text-left mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">What about other tracking technologies?</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        In addition to cookies, we may use:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2">
        <li>
          <strong>Web beacons (tracking pixels):</strong> Tiny invisible images that let us know when you visit a page or open an email.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local storage:</strong> Similar to cookies but can store larger amounts of data for site preferences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 mt-4">
        Many of these rely on cookies to function properly, so blocking cookies may impair certain features.
